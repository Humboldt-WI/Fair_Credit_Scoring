# Data sets

The experiments are performed on seven credit scoring data sets:
- `german` - available at [the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)).
- `taiwan` - available at [the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients).
- `pakdd` - availbale from [PAKDD 2010 Data Mining Competition](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2010/03/f-pakdd-2010-data-mining-competition.html).
- `gmsc` - availbale from [Kaggle Give Me Some Credit competition](https://kaggle.com/c/givemesomecredit]).
- `homecredit` - availbale from [Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk competition](https://kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk).
- `bene` - obtained from: *Baesens, B., Van Gestel, T., Viaene, S., Stepanova, M., Suykens, J., & Vanthienen, J. (2003). Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring. Journal of the operational research society, 54(6), 627-635.*
- `uk` - obtained from: *Baesens, B., Van Gestel, T., Viaene, S., Stepanova, M., Suykens, J., & Vanthienen, J. (2003). Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring. Journal of the operational research society, 54(6), 627-635.*

The raw data sets `bene` and `uk` are subject to an NDA and are not included in this repo. Data set `homecredit` is not included due to size limitation.
